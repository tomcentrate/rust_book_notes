# Working through the Rustbook

Just working through all the examples from the Rustlang book. Also contains notes and all that to make it easier to review later...

# Compiling and Running

- To compile a plain .rs file, you can use `rustc`. This acts very similar to gcc, so you can type `rustc main.rs`

# Cargo

Cargo is the package manager. You can use the following commands:

- `cargo build` - build a development version
- `cargo build --release` - build release version
- `cargo run` - build and run
- `cargo new <app_name> -- bin` - create a new binary (project)
